GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual tool to access and navigate our computer system. The icons and displays are user friendly and make finding and identifying folders and files easier with pictures and labels. With the GUI we can also adjust for size and display options to suit our preferences. The CLI (Command Line Interface) is a useful way to navigate folders/directories and find files if you know the name of what you are looking for. Both tools are used to organize all the information held within our computers.
